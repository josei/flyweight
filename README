Flyweight
=========

A plugin for flyweight pattern fields in models.

Example
=======

  class Profile
    flyweight :education
    flyweight :parents_education, :with=>:educations
  end
  
  en:
    educations:
      none: 'No education'
      primary: 'Primary school'
      high_school: 'High school'
      bachelor: 'Bachelor degree'
      graduate: 'Graduate'
      master: 'Master'
      mba: 'MBA'
      doctor: 'Doctor'

That's equivalent to:

  class Profile
    def self.educations_values
      [:none, :primary, :high_school, :bachelor, :graduate, :master, :mba, :doctor ]
    end
  
    validates :education, :inclusion=>{:in=>educations_values}
    validates :parent_education, :inclusion=>{:in=>educations_values}
    
    def education_to_s
      I18n::t("educations.#{education}")
    end
  end

  en:
    educations:
      none: 'No education'
      primary: 'Primary school'
      high_school: 'High school'
      bachelor: 'Bachelor degree'
      graduate: 'Graduate'
      master: 'Master'
      mba: 'MBA'
      doctor: 'Doctor'

This makes it easy to manage a property's allowed values and i18n them. The plugin also integrates nicely with simple_form
